# Customer Retention and Churn Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn data for a telecom company, aiming to understand the factors contributing to customer attrition and how to improve retention strategies. The goal is to identify patterns in customer behavior, predict churn, and provide actionable insights that can help reduce churn rates and enhance customer loyalty.

## Objective
The main objectives of this analysis are to:
- Identify key factors leading to customer churn.
- Develop a predictive model for churn.
- Suggest strategies for improving customer retention based on data insights.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn)**: For data cleaning, preprocessing, and model building.
- **Power BI**: For interactive visualizations of churn metrics.
- **SQL**: Used to query and manipulate the dataset.

## Key Metrics Analyzed
1. **Churn Rate**: Percentage of customers who discontinued services.
2. **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**: Estimated revenue from a customer before churn.
3. **Tenure**: How long customers stay with the company.
4. **Service Usage**: Amount and types of services used by customers who churned vs. retained.

## Insights & Recommendations
- **High Churn Risk**: Customers with lower tenure and higher service complaints are at greater risk of churn.
- **Retention Strategies**: Offering targeted discounts and improving service quality for customers who are nearing the end of their contracts can help retain them.
- **Predictive Modeling**: A churn prediction model was developed using logistic regression, providing a churn probability score for each customer.

## Visualizations
The Power BI dashboard includes the following visualizations:
- **Churn rate trends over time**.
- **Churn rate by service type and customer demographics**.
- **Retention rate and revenue impact**.
- **Predictive model scores for at-risk customers**.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Satyam18g/customer-retention-analysis.git
   ```
2. Run the Python scripts to preprocess the data and build the churn prediction model.
3. Open the Power BI dashboard to explore insights and visualize trends.

## Future Enhancements
- Incorporating customer sentiment data from surveys to further refine churn predictions.
- Implementing a live dashboard that updates with real-time customer data.
